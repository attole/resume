most of json themes are broken in one way or another
stackoverflow theme is fine, but not exported to pdf by resumed

generated html is changed and polished:
- deleted all bars and levels elements
- changed all big heading to smaller or just normal text
- image is made smaller
- all double <p> are simplified to single one, added consistency to others text elements
- manually added "categories" to hightlight lists
- hover background is added to all list items
- links on projects/work are changed and relocated
- dates on projects/work are set to always be on right
- deleted company splitter on work items

on pdf specific html copy (under src/edited/) skills are simplified to one inline list
